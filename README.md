# Encoding on preprocessing data using telco dataset
A repo with a purpose to showcase how to preprocessing data using telco_customer_churn as a dataset

In this article, we'll  discuss about data preprocessing using telco_customer as a dataset. The most emphasized thing in here is using encoding method such as mean encoding, ordinal encoding, and one hot encoding. Last, you'll see how to get to know about data outlier using dataset of 'tips' and served using boxplot, in our result there's nothing to worry about because the outlier is not the extreme one.
